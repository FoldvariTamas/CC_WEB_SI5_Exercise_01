# CC_WEB_SI5_Exercise_01
In this exercise we will practice what we have learned so far, we will use Express.js as our backend, Mongodb as our database and React.js 18 as our frontend.

Task description:

1. - Observe the starting data provided in the data.js in the backend, and create a Mongoose schema accordingly, and create a collection for it as well (You will only need one collection so far).

2 [Optional]. - Write a function inside of the data.js which will fill our database with the provided starting data. You can also skip this and continue.

3. - Create an endpoint which will return all the data stored in our collection.

4. - Create an endpoint which can add a new record to our collection.

5. - Delete the App.jsx and the Asd123.jsx and replace them with a new file called Mainpage.jsx. You can access this page in "http://localhost:3000/".

6. - At the top of this page create a form which we will use to post a new question.

7 [Optional]. - Find a solution for showing a response message in the frontend, if we could successfully add a new question then let the user know and if not than also display a message.                    (The message should appear near the form.)

8. - We want to be able to list all the questions in our home page bellow the from, only the title of the question will be shown. When we click on any of these titles the frontend should navigate us to a new page where we can see more information about the question. (create the required page and endpoint for it)

9. - In this new page we want to be able to post an answer to this question.
